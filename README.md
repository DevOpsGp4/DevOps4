## Code Of Conduct

### Rule 1 : Team membership as coworkers
     All team members are equal; every team member’s opinion will be thoughtfully considered; each team member will keep all commitments by the agreed upon due date; each team member agrees to constantly assess whether team members are honoring their commitment to the team norms. 
### Rule 2 : Communication
    Team members will speak respectfully to each other; will not talk down to each other; will positively recognize and thank each other for team contributions.
### Rule 3 : Team member interaction in meetings
    Team members will listen without interrupting; hold no side or competing conversations; follow the rules for effective meetings; attend the meetings on time; always work from an agenda; minutes will be recorded at each meeting; end meetings on time. 
### Rule 4 : Team problem solving, conflict resolution and decision making
    Team members will make decisions by consensus, but majority will rule if timely consensus is not reached; conflicts will be resolved directly with the persons in conflict. 
### Rule 5 : Respect in the workplace
    All team members should respect their teammates. We won’t allow any kind of discriminatory behavior, harassment or victimization. Team Members should conform with our equal opportunity policy in all aspects of their work, from recruitment and performance evaluation to interpersonal relations.
